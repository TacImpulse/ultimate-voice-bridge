## üéØ Best Practices

### üì¢ **Recording Quality**
- **Quiet Environment**: Record in a quiet room without echo
- **Good Microphone**: Use a quality microphone for best results
- **Consistent Distance**: Maintain consistent distance from microphone
- **Natural Speech**: Speak naturally, not too fast or slow
- **Clear Pronunciation**: Articulate words clearly

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Audio Duration**
- **Minimum**: At least 10 seconds for reasonable quality
- **Optimal**: 30-60 seconds for best results
- **Maximum**: Up to 5 minutes supported
- **Multiple Samples**: Consider creating multiple voice samples for better quality

### üìù **Transcript Accuracy**
- **Exact Match**: Transcript should exactly match what's spoken
- **Punctuation**: Include proper punctuation for natural synthesis
- **Numbers/Dates**: Write out numbers as words ("twenty-five" not "25")
- **Contractions**: Use natural contractions ("I'm" not "I am")

### üé§ **Voice Content**
- **Varied Speech**: Include different emotions and speaking styles
- **Complete Sentences**: Use full sentences rather than fragments
- **Natural Flow**: Speak conversationally, not like reading a script
- **Personality**: Let your natural speaking personality come through
