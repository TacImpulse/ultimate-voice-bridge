```

Expected output:
```
NVIDIA-SMI 555.xx Driver Version: 555.xx CUDA Version: 13.0
GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (UUID: GPU-xxx)
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
```powershell
cd backend

# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install GPU-specific requirements
pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt
```

Key packages that will be installed:
- `torch==2.10.0.dev20250924+cu130` - PyTorch with CUDA 13.0
- `coqui-tts==0.27.0` - Coqui TTS engine
- `transformers>=4.35.0` - Model loading
- `soundfile>=0.12.0` - Audio file handling

### Step 4: Verify Text Formatting Fix (v5.2 Breakthrough)
```powershell
# Test the critical text formatting fix
python test_voice_clone_fix.py
```

**Expected Success Output:**
```
🧪 Testing VibeVoice text formatting...
✅ PASS - Correct speaker formatting (Test 1)
✅ PASS - Correct speaker formatting (Test 2) 
✅ PASS - Correct speaker formatting (Test 3)
This fix should resolve the 'No valid speaker lines found in script' error!
```

### Step 5: Verify VibeVoice Setup
```powershell
# Run the direct test (this will download the 5.4GB model)
python test_vibevoice_directly.py
```

**Expected Success Output:**
```
✅ CUDA environment configured:
   CUDA_HOME: C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.0
   NVCC available: True
   GPU Architecture: 8.9
   PyTorch CUDA available: True
   GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090
   VRAM: 31.8GB

Loading checkpoint shards: 100%|██████████| 3/3 [00:02<00:00,  1.37it/s]
✅ VibeVoice generated 192044 bytes of audio
🎧 Saved audio to test_vibevoice_output.wav

📋 Available voices: 7
  - vibevoice-alice: Alice (Expressive female voice, great for conversations)
  - vibevoice-andrew: Andrew (Confident male voice, ideal for narration)
  - vibevoice-large-alice: Alice (Large) (Ultra-high quality Alice with VibeVoice-Large model)
```

### Step 6: Test Audio Output
```powershell
# Play the generated audio file
start test_vibevoice_output.wav
```

You should hear Alice's voice saying: "Hello! This is a test of VibeVoice voice cloning technology."

## 🔥 v5.2 BREAKTHROUGH: Perfect Custom Voice Cloning

### 🎯 The Critical Fix
Version 5.2 introduces **automatic text formatting** that permanently solves the "No valid speaker lines found in script" error:

```python
# OLD (BROKEN): Plain text fails
text = "Hello! This is my custom voice clone test."
# ❌ Error: No valid speaker lines found

# NEW (WORKING): Automatically formatted
text = "Speaker 0: Hello! This is my custom voice clone test."
# ✅ Perfect: VibeVoice processes successfully
```

### 🎭 Custom Voice Clone Workflow (Now Perfect)
1. **Upload Audio**: Drag & drop your voice sample (WAV/MP3/FLAC)
2. **Auto-Transcription**: Whisper STT automatically transcribes
3. **Create Clone**: VibeVoice-Large creates your custom voice
4. **Test Clone**: Text automatically formatted with "Speaker 0:" prefix
5. **Generate Audio**: Custom voice clone produces perfect results
6. **Success**: No more text formatting errors, ever!

### ✅ What's Fixed
- **✅ Text Formatting**: Automatic "Speaker 0:" annotation
- **✅ Error Elimination**: "No valid speaker lines" error gone forever
- **✅ Smart Detection**: Preserves existing speaker annotations
- **✅ Universal Fix**: Works for all voice clones and VibeVoice engines
- **✅ Zero Config**: Completely transparent to users

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "VibeVoice not available"
**Solution**: Flash Attention fallback working ✅
```python
# Automatic fallback implemented
try:
    import flash_attn
    attn_impl = "flash_attention_2"
except ImportError:
    attn_impl = "sdpa"  # ✅ This works
```

### Issue 2: "Got unsupported ScalarType BFloat16"
**Solution**: Tensor conversion implemented ✅
```python
# Fixed in vibevoice_service.py
if audio_tensor.dtype == torch.bfloat16:
    audio_tensor = audio_tensor.to(torch.float32)  # ✅ Working
```

### Issue 3: "No valid speaker lines found"
**Solution**: Use correct format ✅
```python
# Correct format that works
test_text = "Speaker 1: Your text here"  # ✅ This works
```

### Issue 4: CUDA environment not found
**Solution**: Check CUDA 13.0 installation ✅
```powershell
# Verify CUDA path
dir "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.0"
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Voice Training
```python
# Create custom voice clone
voice_id = await vibevoice.create_voice_clone(
    name="My Custom Voice",
    transcript="Training text for voice clone",
    audio_data=audio_bytes,
    description="Custom voice description"
)

# Test the custom voice
audio = await vibevoice.test_voice_clone(voice_id, "Hello from my custom voice!")
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple texts
texts = [
    "Speaker 1: First sentence to generate.",
    "Speaker 2: Second sentence with different voice.",
    "Speaker 1: Back to the first speaker."
]

for text in texts:
    audio = await vibevoice.generate_speech(text=text, voice="vibevoice-alice")
```

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Use Proper Speaker Format**: Always use "Speaker X: text" format
2. **Monitor VRAM**: Keep an eye on GPU memory usage during long sessions
3. **Audio Quality**: Use high-quality voice samples for best results
4. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple requests efficiently
5. **Error Handling**: Always implement fallback mechanisms

## 🔮 Next Steps

Once you have VibeVoice working:

1. **Integrate with Frontend**: Connect to the web interface
2. **Custom Voice Training**: Create personalized voice models  
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Experiment with different language models
4. **Production Deployment**: Scale for real-world applications
5. **API Integration**: Build custom applications with VibeVoice

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure RTX 5090, CUDA 13.0, Python 3.12
2. **Run Test Script**: `python test_vibevoice_directly.py`
3. **Check Audio Output**: Verify `test_vibevoice_output.wav` is created
4. **Review Logs**: Look for specific error messages in console output
5. **GPU Monitoring**: Use `nvidia-smi` to check GPU utilization
