## Architecture

### Core Components

#### ConversationEngine (`services/conversation_engine.py`)
The main orchestrator that coordinates all conversation generation aspects.

```python
from services.conversation_engine import ConversationEngine, ConversationStyle, EmotionType

# Initialize with VibeVoice integration
engine = ConversationEngine(vibevoice_service)

# Generate conversation
audio_data, metadata = await engine.create_dynamic_conversation(
    script=conversation_script,
    speaker_mapping={"Speaker 1": "voice_id_1", "Speaker 2": "voice_id_2"},
    conversation_style=ConversationStyle.PODCAST,
    add_natural_interactions=True,
    emotional_intelligence=True
)
```

#### Speaker Profiles (`SpeakerProfile` class)
Each speaker gets a unique profile with:
- Speaking rate (0.5-2.0x)
- Personality traits (energetic, calm, authoritative, etc.)
- Interruption likelihood (0-1)
- Pause preferences
- Emotional tendencies

#### Conversation Segments (`ConversationSegment` class)
Individual speech units containing:
- Speaker identification
- Text content
- Detected emotion
- Pause durations (before/after)
- Speech rate adjustments
- Emphasis words
- Optional background sounds

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Script Parsing**: Extract speakers and dialogue from formatted text
2. **Profile Generation**: Create unique speaker characteristics based on conversation style
3. **Emotion Detection**: Analyze text for emotional patterns using regex and context
4. **Pause Calculation**: Determine natural pause durations based on punctuation and style
5. **Natural Interactions**: Add interruptions, reactions, and overlapping speech
6. **Audio Generation**: Synthesize speech for each segment with VibeVoice
7. **Post-Processing**: Apply effects, mix segments, and add background ambience
8. **Metadata Creation**: Calculate analytics and performance metrics

## Frontend Integration

### React Component (`ConversationEngine.tsx`)

The frontend provides a comprehensive interface with:

- **Template Library**: Pre-built conversation examples (Interview, Debate, Podcast)
- **Script Editor**: Monaco-like textarea with syntax highlighting
- **Speaker Management**: Dynamic speaker-to-voice mapping
- **Style Selection**: Dropdown with style descriptions
- **Advanced Settings**: Toggles for interactions, emotions, and background sound
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live conversation statistics and emotion distribution
- **Audio Player**: Built-in playback controls with download functionality

### Usage Example

```typescript
// Load conversation styles
const styles = await fetch('/api/v1/conversation/styles').then(r => r.json());

// Generate conversation
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('script', conversationScript);
formData.append('speaker_mapping', JSON.stringify(speakerMappings));
formData.append('conversation_style', 'podcast');
formData.append('emotional_intelligence', 'true');

const response = await fetch('/api/v1/conversation/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});

// Get metadata from headers
const duration = response.headers.get('X-Conversation-Duration');
const complexity = response.headers.get('X-Interaction-Complexity');

// Play generated audio
const audioBlob = await response.blob();
const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
```

## Advanced Features

### Emotion Detection Patterns

The system uses sophisticated regex patterns to detect emotions:

```python
emotion_patterns = {
    EmotionType.EXCITED: [
        r"\b(wow|amazing|incredible|fantastic|awesome)\b",
        r"[!]{2,}",  # Multiple exclamation marks
        r"\b(really|so|very) [a-z]+\b"  # Intensifiers
    ],
    EmotionType.CONFIDENT: [
        r"\b(absolutely|definitely|certainly|of course|exactly)\b",
        r"\b(I know|I'm sure|without doubt)\b"
    ]
}
```

### Natural Pause Calculation

Pause durations are context-aware and style-dependent:

```python
def calculate_natural_pauses(text, speaker, previous_speaker, style):
    pause_config = pause_patterns[style]
    
    # Base pause after speaker change
    pause_before = pause_config["speaker_change"] if speaker != previous_speaker else 0.2
    
    # Punctuation-based pauses
    if text.endswith('?'):
        pause_after = pause_config["question"]  # Longer for questions
    elif ',' in text:
        pause_after = pause_config["comma"]     # Short for commas
    
    # Add thinking pauses for complex thoughts
    if any(word in text.lower() for word in ['however', 'therefore', 'furthermore']):
        pause_after += pause_config["thinking"]
    
    return pause_before, pause_after
```

### Speaker Interaction Complexity

The system calculates interaction complexity based on:

- **Speaker Changes**: Frequency of speaker transitions
- **Emotional Variety**: Range of emotions used
- **Question/Answer Patterns**: Conversational flow indicators
- **Interruptions**: Short responses and reactions

```python
def calculate_interaction_complexity(segments):
    speaker_variety = speaker_changes / len(segments)
    emotion_variety = len(emotions_used) / len(EmotionType)
    interaction_density = (questions + short_responses) / len(segments)
    
    complexity = (speaker_variety + emotion_variety + interaction_density) / 3
    return min(1.0, complexity)  # Cap at 1.0
```

## Configuration

### Conversation Style Configuration

Each style has unique timing characteristics:

```python
pause_patterns = {
    ConversationStyle.PODCAST: {
        "sentence_end": 1.0,    # Professional pacing
        "comma": 0.4,           # Clear breaks
        "question": 1.5,        # Thoughtful questions
        "speaker_change": 1.8,  # Smooth transitions
        "interruption": 0.02,   # Minimal interruptions
        "thinking": 1.0         # Thoughtful pauses
    },
    ConversationStyle.DEBATE: {
        "sentence_end": 0.4,    # Fast-paced
        "comma": 0.15,          # Quick breaks
        "question": 1.0,        # Direct questions
        "speaker_change": 0.3,  # Rapid transitions
        "interruption": 0.0,    # No interruptions
        "thinking": 0.2         # Minimal thinking time
    }
}
```
