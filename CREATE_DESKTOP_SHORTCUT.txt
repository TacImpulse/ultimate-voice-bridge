🎯 WHAT THE LAUNCHER DOES:
-------------------------
✅ Kills any existing backend/frontend processes
✅ Starts the backend server (Python/FastAPI)
✅ Starts the frontend server (Next.js/React)  
✅ Waits for services to initialize
✅ Tests backend connectivity
✅ Opens your browser to http://localhost:3000/voice
✅ Shows colorful status updates

⚡ QUICK START:
--------------
1. Double-click your desktop shortcut
2. Wait 15-20 seconds for everything to start
3. Your browser will automatically open to the voice chat
4. Start recording and chatting with your AI models!

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:
------------------
• If services don't start: Check that Python and Node.js are in your PATH
• If ports are busy: The launcher kills existing processes first
• If browser doesn't open: Manually go to http://localhost:3000/voice
• Backend issues: Check the "🔧 Voice Bridge Backend" window for errors
• Frontend issues: Check the "🎨 Voice Bridge Frontend" window for errors

🎉 ENJOY YOUR VOICE BRIDGE!
